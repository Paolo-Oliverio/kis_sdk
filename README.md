The KIS SDK is a comprehensive C++ development toolkit designed to accelerate the creation of complex, cross-platform applications. 
It provides a curated collection of reusable libraries (packages) built upon a powerful and flexible CMake-based build system. 
The SDK manages both first-party and third-party dependencies, ensures consistent builds across compilers, and supports both integrated (superbuild) and standalone package development workflows.
